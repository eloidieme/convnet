ConvNet
==============================

A deep learning project to learn convolutional networks. It predicts a name's origin. To try it, run the command:
```python main.py````
And enter your name.

The model is a CNN with 2 convolutional layers and one fully-connected layer, implemented from scratch using PyTorch tensors. Made as part of the course DD2424: Deep Learning in Data Science at KTH, Stockholm.
The model used for inference achieve 49% accuracy on the test data, which could be improved, by using a different approach.
