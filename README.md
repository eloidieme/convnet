ConvNet
==============================

A deep learning project to learn convolutional networks. It predicts a name's origin. To try it, run the command:
```python main.py````
And enter your name.

The model is a CNN with 2 convolutional layers and one fully-connected layer, implemented from scratch using PyTorch tensors.
